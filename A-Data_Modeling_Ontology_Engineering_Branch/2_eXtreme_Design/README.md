# Using the eXtreme Design Methodology

This knowledge engineering project has followed the eXtreme Design (XD) methodology proposed by Bloomqvist. eXtreme Design (XD) is an ontology design methodology whose core principle is ontology design patterns (ODP) reuse, as an explicit activity. ODPs are small ontologies which, ideally, form the bigger ontology with the correct alignment. They mediate between use cases (problem types) and design solutions. 

## Stories and Competency Questions

The general XD methodology first requires a focus on stories and Competency Questions (CQs). To do so, the ontology engineers get in close and frequent contact with domain experts, so as to collect the requirements for the ontology in the form of stories. The key information that a story should contain is the goal/objective of the story and questions that need to be answered in order to reach that goal. Once the stories are collected, they are prioritized and then broken down by the ontology engineers. They identify the main concepts and the possible general constraints from the user stories to create Competency Questions (CQs). A complete list of competency questions for this ontology can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f12wkdOa-a24GMtxxS5N_OKMapnWtygOdGr5gI7P3DU/edit?usp=sharing). They were extracted from the story below. 

>"When surfing the Visual Genome dataset, I want to search images that contain objects in them. It is great to know if the objects have attributes associated with them. If there is more than one object in the image, I need to know about the relation that exists between these objects. Regarding the regions of the objects and the regions of relations, I want to identify the region that they are included in. I need to investigate if the image evokes any conceptual frames and if the frames are involved in these regions. I am also keen to find out the bounding boxes that cover the objects, relations and regions and the location and surface of the bounding boxes in the image. I would like to know the size of the image to understand which percentage of the image the object (bounding box of the object) and relation occupy. An interesting aspect is to search about the synsets that are related to objects, regions, relations and frames."
