# Error Provocation Test

Another important characteristic of an ontology is to allow as few erroneous facts or inferences as possible. This category of testing is comparable to software testing when a system is fed random or incorrect data, or data considered as "boundary values" of the input, e.g. the extremes of value ranges, in order to check robustness.

In the subfolders, you can find test cases for each of the requirements for the EP testing and the toy datasets for each of the test cases.
